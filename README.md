## Phase 1: Create Project Documentation

Before coding, we'll draft a professional project document. This is crucial for clarity, scalability planning, and future maintenance. I'll provide the full content of the document here—you can copy it into a Markdown file (e.g., `PROJECT_DOC.md`) or a Google Doc for your reference. Customize it as needed.

### Project Documentation: DataPros Community Blog Platform

#### 1. Project Overview
- **Project Name**: DataPros Blog Platform
- **Description**: A full-featured community blog website for data professionals (e.g., data scientists, analysts, engineers) to publish articles, share insights, and provide resources. It supports expert contributions, user interactions, and scalable handling of content.
- **Target Audience**: Data professionals, enthusiasts, and experts in related fields.
- **Key Goals**:
  - Enable publishing of articles with rich media (images, videos, files).
  - Foster community engagement via comments, likes, shares, and user profiles.
  - Handle ~1000 daily visitors and 30-100 article posts per day.
  - Ensure scalability, reliability, and security.
- **Expected Traffic & Scale**:
  - Daily Visitors: 1000 (peak).
  - Daily Posts: 30-100.
  - Scalability: Designed for horizontal scaling (e.g., via AWS EC2/ASG for servers, database sharding if needed).
- **Tech Stack**:
  - **Backend Framework**: Django (for core web app, admin panel, and templating).
  - **API Layer**: FastAPI (for high-performance RESTful/GraphQL endpoints, e.g., for mobile apps or integrations).
  - **Databases**:
    - MySQL: For structured data (users, posts metadata, comments).
    - MongoDB: For unstructured/scalable data (article content, logs, user-generated documents).
  - **Storage**: AWS S3 (for media files, images, backups).
  - **Other Tools**: Celery (task queue for background jobs like email notifications), Redis (caching), Nginx (reverse proxy), Docker (containerization), Gunicorn/Uvicorn (servers).
  - **Frontend**: Django templates with Bootstrap/JavaScript (or integrate React if needed for SPA features).
  - **Deployment**: AWS (EC2 for hosting, RDS for MySQL, ElastiCache for Redis, etc.).
- **Monetization/Extensions (Future)**: Ads, premium subscriptions, integrations with tools like Jupyter notebooks.

#### 2. Features
- **Core Features**:
  - User registration/login (email, social auth via Google/OAuth).
  - User profiles (bio, expertise, published articles).
  - Article creation/editing (rich text editor, e.g., CKEditor or TinyMCE).
  - Article categories/tags (e.g., Machine Learning, Data Engineering).
  - Search functionality (full-text search via Django Haystack or Elasticsearch integration).
  - Comments system with moderation.
  - Likes, shares, and bookmarks.
- **Advanced Features**:
  - Real-time notifications (e.g., via WebSockets with Django Channels).
  - Analytics dashboard for admins (post views, user engagement).
  - File uploads/downloads (resources like datasets, PDFs stored in S3).
  - API endpoints (FastAPI) for third-party access (e.g., fetch articles programmatically).
- **Admin Features**:
  - Django admin panel for content moderation.
  - User management and analytics.
- **Security & Performance**:
  - Authentication: JWT/OAuth.
  - Rate limiting, CSRF protection.
  - Caching (Redis) for high-traffic pages.
  - Backup: Automated S3 snapshots.
  - Monitoring: Integrate Prometheus/Grafana or AWS CloudWatch.

#### 3. Architecture Diagram (High-Level)
(You can sketch this in tools like Draw.io or Lucidchart. Description:)
- **Frontend**: Browser → Django Templates (HTML/CSS/JS) → FastAPI (for API calls).
- **Backend**: Django (handles requests) → FastAPI (API router for performance-critical endpoints).
- **Databases**: Django ORM → MySQL (structured); PyMongo → MongoDB (documents).
- **Storage**: Boto3 → AWS S3.
- **Queue/Cache**: Celery → Redis.
- **Deployment Flow**: Code → Git → Docker → AWS EC2 → Nginx → Gunicorn (Django) / Uvicorn (FastAPI).

#### 4. Requirements & Dependencies
- **Hardware/Software**:
  - Development: Python 3.10+, Virtualenv/Pipenv.
  - Production: AWS account, domain name.
- **Python Packages** (via `requirements.txt`):
  - django==4.2.*
  - fastapi==0.100.*
  - uvicorn==0.22.*
  - mysqlclient==2.2.*
  - pymongo==4.4.*
  - boto3==1.28.*
  - celery==5.3.*
  - redis==4.6.*
  - django-storages==1.14.* (for S3 integration)
  - Other: pillow (image processing), django-ckeditor (rich editor), etc.
- **Non-Python**: MySQL 8.0, MongoDB 6.0, AWS CLI.

#### 5. Development Roadmap
- Phase 1: Setup & Core Backend (Django + Databases).
- Phase 2: API Integration (FastAPI).
- Phase 3: Storage & Media (AWS S3).
- Phase 4: Frontend & Features.
- Phase 5: Testing, Deployment, Scaling.

#### 6. Risks & Mitigations
- **Scalability**: Use load balancers; monitor with AWS tools.
- **Data Consistency**: Hybrid DB approach—sync critical data between MySQL/MongoDB.
- **Costs**: AWS free tier for dev; optimize S3 storage.
- **Security**: Regular audits; use HTTPS.

#### 7. Timeline Estimate
- Documentation: 1-2 days.
- Setup: 2-3 days.
- Core Features: 1-2 weeks.
- Testing/Deployment: 1 week.
- Total: 3-4 weeks (part-time).

#### 8. Contributors & Version History
- Initial Version: v1.0 (September 26, 2025).
- Author: Anurag Verma.
